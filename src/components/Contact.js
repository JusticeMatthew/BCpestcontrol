      <p>
        Welcome to B&C Pest Control, a locally owned company.
        <br />
        <br /> Our company was started more than 30 years ago by our friend Bob
        Carpenter, and when it was time for him to retire, he passed along his
        years of knowledge to Garry Reese. Bob and his wife Carol are like
        family to us. We have known them for 20 years and are very grateful to
        continue the quality service Bob started all those years ago.
